Fast Solvers for Batched Convex Optimization

The mpc-solver is a fast solver for solving huge number of QPs and LPs. It is capable of solving millions of independent QPs and LPs with similar structure in few seconds using techniques like parallelisation. It also supports the solves on a GPU, hence improving the performance furthermore.
